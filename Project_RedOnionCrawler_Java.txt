My name is Jere Sumell and my ambitious goal is to program some kind of Webcrawler in Java for educational purposes.

There¨s four steps stading on the roots:

1. Receiving the source document (URL Source code)
2. Parsing the outcoming links.
3. Saving the texts written in paragrapghs to the memory.
4. Finding for the matches equalled to the user¨s search term (keyword).
5. Outputting the relevant content and metadata for the matches.
